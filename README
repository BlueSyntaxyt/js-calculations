- This package makes it easy to integrate checks and calculations, you can check if A == B and then put a variable to true or false. Example:

var MyNum = 10;
var MyBool = calculations.Check(1, MyNum);

console.log(MyBool);

//This would log false, since 1 is not equal to 10.

Example 2:

var Answer = 0;
var NumOne = "4";
var NumTwo = 1;
IS = calculations.Maths(A, B, "+=");
console.log(IS);

//This would return 5.
